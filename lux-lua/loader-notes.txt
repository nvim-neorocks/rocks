Currently, we assume a single version of the loader is used everywhere.
The `lx path` command should not only generate the code to load the loader, but should also compare against `_VERSION` to see if it even *can*.

Currently, support for searching through dev and build dependencies is unsupported, and we should have some way of detecting when we're in those modes
(probably through environment variables that lux sets?)

Current, the loader does not isolate dependencies from potentially impure places, as it delegates anything it can't find to further searchers.
This is a tricky topic - we probably don't want to overwrite the existing searchers as there may be some important ones (?), but we also want to ensure
that dependencies that shouldn't be found aren't found. I am considering hijacking the `package.searchers` entirely and just making the lux
loader do all the work.
