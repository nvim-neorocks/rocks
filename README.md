# A [WIP] Library & Client implementation of [`luarocks`](https://github.com/luarocks/luarocks)

> [!WARNING]
>
> **lux is a work in progress
> and does not have a stable release yet.**

Lux serves as an application for:

- Installing and managing rocks
- Creating Lua projects with dependencies, build scripts and desired Lua versions
- Creating and publishing your own rocks
- Embedding rock manipulation logic into your own application

> [!NOTE]
>
> This aims to be a full rewrite of `luarocks`, with many flags altered to be more
> ergonomic. This is not a drop-in replacement for `luarocks` commands you may have in scripts.

## :books: Usage

```sh
lx <command> <options>
```

To view available options and their descriptions, run `lx --help`.

## Comparison with [`luarocks v3.11.1`](https://github.com/luarocks/luarocks)

As this project is still a work in progress, some luarocks features
have not been (fully) implemented yet.
On the other hand, lux has some features that are not present in luarocks.

The following table provides a brief (incomplete) comparison:
